        "Python OOPs Assignment Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "Q1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions. Objects represent real-world entities and contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). OOP improves code reusability, modularity, scalability, and maintainability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A class is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the attributes and methods that the objects created from it will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and contains actual values for the attributes defined in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features, while encapsulation bundles data and methods together and restricts direct access to data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5.  What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Dunder (double underscore) methods are special methods in Python that begin and end with __. They enable operator overloading and built-in behavior, such as __init__, __str__, and __add__.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reuse and establishes a parent-child relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Polymorphism allows the same method name to have different implementations based on the object calling it. This increases flexibility and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Encapsulation is achieved by using private variables (prefixed with __) and providing public methods to access and modify them safely.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> A constructor is a special method __init__() that is automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Class methods operate on class variables and use the @classmethod decorator, while static methods do not depend on class or instance data and use @staticmethod.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Python does not support traditional method overloading. It is achieved using default arguments or variable-length arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12.  What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Method overriding occurs when a child class provides its own implementation of a method defined in the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, enabling controlled access to private variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> In OOP, Polymorphism allows code to be flexible, extensible, and easier to maintain by enabling different behaviors with the same interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains abstract methods that must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Advantages of OOP are OOP provides modularity, reusability, scalability, data security, and easier debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Class variables are shared among all objects, while instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "-> __str__ returns a readable string representation, while __repr__ returns an unambiguous representation mainly for debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The super() function allows access to methods of the parent class without explicitly naming it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The __del__ method is called when an object is destroyed and is used for cleanup operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22.  What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Static methods do not access class data, while class methods can access and modify class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23.  How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Polymorphism in Python allows the same method name to behave differently depending on the object that calls it. With inheritance, polymorphism is mainly achieved through method overriding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, with each method returning the object itself (or another object that supports further calls).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "-> The __call__ method in Python is used to make an object behave like a function. When a class defines __call__, its instances can be called using parentheses () just like a normal function.\n",
